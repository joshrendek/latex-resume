\resheading{Introduction}
I love working on hard problems, system and test automation, scaling/performance problems, and data mining.
I always want to be learning new things and finding the right solution for the problem at hand. I am a fullstack developer and love helping others learn.
I also enjoy writing from time to time on my blog.
